Step 1: Generating Keys

To start, we need to generate two large prime numbers, p and q. These primes should be of roughly equal length and their product should be much larger than the message we want to encrypt.

We can generate the primes using any primality testing algorithm, such as the Miller-Rabin test. Once we have the two primes, we can compute their product n = p*q, which will be the modulus for our RSA system.

Next, we need to choose an integer e such that 1 < e < phi(n) and gcd(e, phi(n)) = 1, where phi(n) = (p-1)*(q-1) is Eulerâ€™s totient function. This value of e will be the public key exponent.

To compute the private key exponent d, we need to find an integer d such that d*e = 1 (mod phi(n)). This can be done using the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Our public key is (n, e) and our private key is (n, d).

Step 2: Encryption

To encrypt a message m, we need to convert it to an integer between 0 and n-1. This can be done using a reversible encoding scheme, such as ASCII or UTF-8.

Once we have the integer representation of the message, we compute the ciphertext c as c = m^e (mod n). This can be done efficiently using modular exponentiation algorithms, such as binary exponentiation.

Step 3: Decryption

To decrypt the ciphertext c, we compute the plaintext m as m = c^d (mod n). Again, we can use modular exponentiation algorithms to do this efficiently.
